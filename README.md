# content Based Retrieval System
 

 FOR most video databases, browsing as a means of retrieval is impractical, and query-based searching is required. Queries are often expressed as keywords, requiring the videos to be tagged.
In view of the ever-increasing size of video databases, the assumption of an appropriate and complete set of tags might be invalid, and content-based video retrieval techniques become vital.
Video is an example of multimedia information, which contains a huge set of raw data, richer content information, and made up of continuous still images. This makes the retrieval of videos more tedious and challenging.
The content-based video retrieval has attracted the users as the use of multimedia data has been increased drastically in day-to-day life compared to text-based search. Text-based search or retrieval is good when the database is small and limited.
But when it comes to huge and larger databases or data warehouses, content-based retrieval plays a vital role. Hence making the system more robust and reliable as well as automatized is necessary for the domain of the CBVR system.
The CBVR basically retrieves a related video from the database based on visual contents like color, texture, edge, shape, and motion.
